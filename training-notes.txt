Feedback:
-- Day 1 --
Better setup instructions
* Too many emails
* Part of the doc?
Maybe chef bootstrap to configure the worstation?
Less intro, dive into the code faster
Slides are too verbose, put content into the notes
This is a sloow course. Speed it up some?
Better microphone for presenter - lost him quickly
Use Windows machine to teach the course.  Instructor is using Mac
**Better setup**
 * Windows VM as a client using cloudshare (?)
 * Virtual Box image ?
 * Installer that configures machine ?
 * Chef bootstrap the workstation ?
* Setup takes way too long (1/2 day).  Preconfigured setup, then explain how this happened
* Instructor teaches on the same preconfigured machine
Start on time - many late times
source code for course on github
Ruby 101
Page 198 there is a typo (Add apache recipe instead of add iis recipe)

-- Day 2 --
Review questions are not clear.  Hard to understand.  some are also trick questions - nooo!
Jumped past sections we didn't do the first day.  need to pick up where we left off
page 285 cookbook names don't match up
nytimes.com hosts update doesn't actually work.  need to update to www.nytimes.com or wildcard (so the example actually works)
need better time management, take things offline when needed to keep the class going
  maybe use the second person a resource for this
  (we wasted over an hour troubleshooting 1 person's issue)
  
Notes:
Node: anything managed by chef
Resource: something that chef can configure
Recipe: Modular piece of functionality.  Cookbook is a collection of recipes
Run List: list of recipes
Role: Predefined list of recipes (run list)
